# Best Practices

Front-End is a software-development-domain that is especially cluttered with approaches, opinions and different ways
of doing things. These techniques all have their place as ultimately you will need to decide the best approach based
on the skills and preferences of your team mates, the rules of the organization the project is developed in and the
requirements of the project at hand. 

Nevertheless it is a good idea to have a set of best practices in mind whenever you start developing a project and
also to know why those ideas are considered best practices in the first place. This will help you find a good approach
to the project at hand and make you more familiar with practices your team are already familiar with.

A currently popular set of best practices was developed by [Hive](http://www.wearehive.co.uk/). Their guide is quite comprehensive,
but differs from the way we currently work in our teams. Still the described ideas are popular approaches in the 
community so it is still beneficial to get an overview. 

So the first task in this tutorial is to read and understand, their set of best practices as they are described
here: https://github.com/wearehive/project-guidelines
