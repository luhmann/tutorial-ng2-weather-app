# Best Practices

Front-End is a software-development-domain that is especially cluttered with approaches, opinions and different ways
of doing things. Most of these approaches are valid and have their place as ultimately you will need to decide on the best approach based on the skills and preferences of your team, the rules and guidelines of your organization and the
requirements of the project at hand. 

Nevertheless it is a good idea to have a set of best practices in mind whenever you start developing a project and
also to know why those ideas are considered best practices in the first place.

One set of best practices, that has been popular in recent weeks is maintained by [Hive](http://www.wearehive.co.uk/). 
It is quite comprehensive and features some of the more popular approaches to developing a frontend project within a larger 
team, even though it is not necessarily what might be practiced in our teams. 

So the first task in this tutorial is to read and understand, their set of best practices as they are described
here: https://github.com/wearehive/project-guidelines

**Tasks**

* Try to read and understand each point that is made here. If you do not grasp a concept immediately that is fine.
* Try to find out more about the concepts that will not make sense immediately by searching for more information.
* Write down any questions you might have and we will discuss them after you have completed the article. 

Afterwards proceed to [Step 2](./002-project-setup.md)
